# SCDAA Coursework 2022-23

## Description

The main goal of this project is to implement a numerical algorithm for solving stochastic control problems using policy iteration combined with the “deep Galerkin method” for solving a linear PDE.

## Environment Setup

To set up the environment, you can follow these steps:

Clone the repository from GitHub:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/monicasteph97/scdaa
```

## Usage

Run the final-stochastic-control.ipynb
